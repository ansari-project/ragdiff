## 4. Representative Examples

### Top faiss-small Wins (Biggest Margins)

**1. What is the region called that is the largest conurbation of the Rhine?**

- **Scores:** faiss-small=85/100, faiss-large=20/100 (margin: +65.0)
- **Reasoning:** faiss-small directly answers the question in its first paragraph, clearly identifying the Rhine-Ruhr region as the largest conurbation of the Rhine in Germany. faiss-large fails to answer the question at all, providing general information about the Rhine river, mentioning Cologne as the biggest city, but never identifying the Rhine-Ruhr region or any conurbation as the answer. faiss-small loses some points for including excessive additional information not directly relevant to the question, but its accuracy and completeness in answering the specific question asked makes it far superior.

**2. What is the magnitude of force divided by when external force is added?**

- **Scores:** faiss-small=75/100, faiss-large=15/100 (margin: +60.0)
- **Reasoning:** faiss-small directly answers the question in its second paragraph, stating that 'the center of mass will experience an acceleration proportional to the magnitude of the external force divided by the mass of the system.' This is the correct answer - external force is divided by mass. faiss-large, while providing extensive information about forces as vectors and their properties, never actually addresses what external force is divided by, making it largely irrelevant to the specific question asked despite being generally accurate about force concepts.

**3. What Jacksonville community is known for having heavy ties to the Navy?**

- **Scores:** faiss-small=85/100, faiss-large=35/100 (margin: +50.0)
- **Reasoning:** faiss-small directly answers the question by identifying Jacksonville's Filipino American community as having heavy ties to the Navy, stating 'Much of Jacksonville's Filipino community served in or has ties to the United States Navy.' faiss-large fails to answer the question at all, providing general historical information about Jacksonville but never identifying any specific community with Navy ties. The question asks for a specific community, which faiss-small provides while faiss-large does not.

### Top faiss-large Wins (Biggest Margins)

**1. What alumni wrote "The Closing of the American Mind"?**

- **Scores:** faiss-small=0/100, faiss-large=100/100 (margin: -100.0)
- **Reasoning:** faiss-small completely fails to answer the question, providing irrelevant information about various alumni and university history without ever mentioning Allan Bloom or 'The Closing of the American Mind.' faiss-large directly and accurately answers the question by identifying Allan Bloom as the author of 'The Closing of the American Mind' in the first paragraph, providing the complete and relevant information needed.

**2. What symbol was employed until early in the 20th century?**

- **Scores:** faiss-small=0/100, faiss-large=95/100 (margin: -95.0)
- **Reasoning:** faiss-small completely fails to answer the question, providing only irrelevant information about imperialism and Warsaw architecture with no mention of any symbol. faiss-large directly and accurately answers the question by identifying the show globe as the symbol used in pharmacy until the early 20th century, providing relevant context about other pharmacy symbols as well. The response is accurate, complete, and highly relevant to the question asked.

**3. How did Celeron handle business on trip?**

- **Scores:** faiss-small=25/100, faiss-large=85/100 (margin: -60.0)
- **Reasoning:** faiss-large provides a focused and comprehensive answer about C√©loron's expedition, including details about his interactions with Native Americans who refused to stop trading with the British, his threats to Old Briton, and his disappointed return to Montreal. It also includes relevant context about the expedition's route and his detailed report about Native American hostility toward the French. faiss-small includes the same core paragraph about C√©loron but buries it among irrelevant information about Washington, Fort Duquesne, and the Yuan dynasty, making it largely off-topic and difficult to extract the relevant answer.
