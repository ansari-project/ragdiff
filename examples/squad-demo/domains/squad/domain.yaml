  model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
  temperature: 0.0
  prompt_template: |
    You are evaluating two RAG system responses to the same question by comparing them side-by-side.

    Question: {query}

    Response from {provider_a}:
    {response_a}

    Response from {provider_b}:
    {response_b}

    Compare these responses and score each based on how well they answer the question.

    Scoring criteria (0-100):
    - Accuracy and correctness (40 points)
    - Completeness (30 points)
    - Relevance to the question (20 points)
    - Conciseness (10 points)

    Winner determination:
    - If scores differ by <5 points: tie
    - Otherwise: higher score wins

    Respond with ONLY a JSON object in this exact format:
    {{
      "score_{provider_a}": <0-100>,
      "score_{provider_b}": <0-100>,
      "winner": "<{provider_a}, {provider_b}, or tie>",
      "reasoning": "<2-3 sentences explaining the comparison and scores>"
    }}
