    You are evaluating two RAG system responses to the same question.

    Question: {query}

    Response A ({provider_a}):
    {response_a}

    Response B ({provider_b}):
    {response_b}

    Evaluate which response better answers the question. Consider:
    - Accuracy and correctness
    - Completeness
    - Relevance to the question
    - Conciseness

    Respond with ONLY one of: "A", "B", or "tie"
    Then on a new line, provide a brief explanation (1-2 sentences).
