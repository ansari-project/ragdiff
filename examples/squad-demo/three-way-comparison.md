**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and provide comprehensive information about colonialism, explaining that it involves a country taking physical control of another territory, exploiting its resources, and establishing settlements. While the responses are accurate and detailed, they lack conciseness for such a straightforward question and include extensive discussion of imperialism that, while related, goes beyond what was asked. The core answer—that colonialism means a country taking physical control of another territory and exploiting its resources—is present but buried in lengthy text.

**Cost:** $0.0087, **Tokens:** 2310

### 59. Who was the leader of the Islamist regime in Sudan?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and provide the same answer. They correctly identify Hassan al-Turabi as the leader of Sudan's Islamist regime in the first paragraph, which directly answers the question. However, both responses include extensive irrelevant information about Egypt, ISIS, and other Islamic movements that have nothing to do with Sudan, significantly reducing their relevance and conciseness scores.

**Cost:** $0.0072, **Tokens:** 1910

### 60. What region does use the term 'private schools' to refer to universities?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and contain the answer to the question in the second paragraph: North America uses the term 'private schools' to refer to universities and tertiary institutions, while the UK and Commonwealth countries restrict the term to primary and secondary levels. However, both responses lack conciseness as they include extensive irrelevant information about India, Philippines, and New Zealand that doesn't address the question. The answer is accurate and complete but buried in unnecessary context.

**Cost:** $0.0078, **Tokens:** 2036

### 61. Where is the Rhine Bridge?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and provide the same information about multiple Rhine bridges (Central Bridge in Basel, Emmerich Rhine Bridge, bridges at Arnhem and Nijmegen, Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen, and Old Rhine Bridge at Constance). However, the question asks 'Where is THE Rhine Bridge' (singular), suggesting a specific bridge, but the responses provide information about many different bridges without clearly identifying which one is being asked about. Both responses lack focus and conciseness for answering a simple location question, resulting in identical moderate scores.

**Cost:** $0.0084, **Tokens:** 2122

### 62. Which TFEU article defines the ordinary legislative procedure that applies for majority of EU acts?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and provide the exact same content. They both correctly identify TFEU article 294 as defining the ordinary legislative procedure in the opening sentence, then provide extensive detail about the procedure and EU governance structure.

**Cost:** $0.0128, **Tokens:** 3763

### 63. What is the magnitude of force divided by when external force is added?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and completely fail to answer the question. The question appears to be asking about force divided by some quantity (likely mass, based on Newton's second law: F=ma, where acceleration a=F/m), but both responses only discuss vector addition of forces, static equilibrium, and Newton's Third Law without addressing division of force magnitude by any quantity. Neither response is relevant to the actual question asked.

**Cost:** $0.0077, **Tokens:** 2041

### 64. What was the target percentage of households BSkyB wanted to reach?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and contain the answer to the question in the first paragraph: BSkyB's target was to reach 36% of households in the UK.

The relevant information is present and accurate, but buried in unnecessary context.

**Cost:** $0.0083, **Tokens:** 2224

### 65. What is the high end of the temperature range in winter?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and provide the same information. Neither response directly answers the question about 'the high end of the temperature range in winter' - they provide various temperature data for different locations (Victorian Alps, Mallee/Wimmera, Fresno) but don't clearly identify which location is being asked about or provide a clear answer to what the high end of winter temperatures is. The responses contain relevant temperature information but lack focus and clarity, mixing data from multiple locations and seasons without addressing the specific question.

**Cost:** $0.0090, **Tokens:** 2399

### 66. What garden was formally only for royalty?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and provide the same answer: The Saxon Garden was formally a royal garden. However, both responses include extensive irrelevant information about Norman conquest, Scottish Parliament, geographical societies, and the Canary Islands that has nothing to do with the question. While they correctly identify the Saxon Garden in the first paragraph, the responses lack conciseness due to all the extraneous content.

**Cost:** $0.0079, **Tokens:** 2135

### 67. What amount of the worlds carbon is stored in the Amazon forest?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and provide the same information. They both accurately answer the question by stating that Amazonian evergreen forests account for about 10% of the world's carbon stores in ecosystems, approximately 1.1 × 10^11 metric tonnes of carbon. While both responses include additional relevant context about carbon absorption/release and biodiversity, they also contain some less relevant information about historical vegetation changes and geographic details, which slightly reduces their conciseness score.

**Cost:** $0.0085, **Tokens:** 2266

### 68. Who challenged the plague theory first?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and provide the same answer to the question. They correctly identify J. F. D. Shrewsbury (1970) as the first significant challenger and Graham Twigg (1984) as producing the first major work directly challenging the theory. However, both responses include substantial irrelevant information about medieval medical theories, immunology history, and alternative theories that don't address who first challenged the plague theory, reducing their conciseness and relevance scores.

**Cost:** $0.0091, **Tokens:** 2433

### 69. What entity owns V/Line?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and provide the correct answer that V/Line is owned by the Victorian Government in the first paragraph. However, both responses include substantial irrelevant information about vBNS, Datanet 1, and Telenet that has nothing to do with V/Line ownership, significantly reducing their relevance and conciseness scores. The correct answer is present but buried in unnecessary content.

**Cost:** $0.0075, **Tokens:** 1983

### 70. Where do ctenophora live?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and provide the same information about ctenophore habitats. While they mention coastal and oceanic species, as well as deep-sea platyctenids, the answer lacks directness and is buried within extensive tangential information about ctenophore biology, classification, and evolution. The responses would score higher with a more concise, direct answer focusing specifically on where ctenophores live (coastal waters, open ocean, and deep sea).

**Cost:** $0.0085, **Tokens:** 2277

### 71. Which central European country had a Calvinist ruler?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and provide the same information. While they mention Prussia's Calvinist Great Elector Frederick William and the Electorate of Brandenburg, these answers are buried in lengthy passages about Huguenots and French Calvinism. Neither response directly or clearly answers which central European country had a Calvinist ruler, making both equally inadequate despite containing relevant information.

**Cost:** $0.0087, **Tokens:** 2395

### 72. How much more land does the school own in Allston than Cambridge?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and contain the same information. They both provide the direct answer in the first paragraph ('approximately fifty percent more land in Allston than in Cambridge') and include relevant supporting details about the specific acreages (358 acres in Allston, 209 acres in Cambridge). However, both responses also include an irrelevant paragraph about UK private schools that detracts from conciseness, preventing either from achieving a higher score.

**Cost:** $0.0081, **Tokens:** 2143

### 73. What was Tymnet

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical, providing the same content word-for-word. The first paragraph accurately answers the question about Tymnet with comprehensive technical details, earning full marks for that section. However, both responses include four additional paragraphs about CSNET, packet switching history, Datanet 1, and NSFNET that are completely irrelevant to the question, significantly reducing the relevance and conciseness scores.

**Cost:** $0.0073, **Tokens:** 1873

### 74. What alumni wrote "The Closing of the American Mind"?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and contain the correct answer (Allan Bloom) in the first paragraph, clearly identifying him as the author of 'The Closing of the American Mind.' However, both responses include extensive irrelevant information about Harvard presidents, other alumni, and historical figures that don't relate to the question. The correct answer is present and accurate, but the lack of conciseness significantly impacts the overall quality of both responses.

**Cost:** $0.0078, **Tokens:** 2074

### 75. What advancements besides military technology did Europe achieve?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and provide the same information. While they mention communication advancements, steam engines, and industrial developments, the responses are poorly structured with irrelevant information about U.S. industries, Warsaw's infrastructure, and colonial imperialism that don't directly answer what non-military advancements Europe achieved. The relevant information (communication, steam engines, industrial machinery) is buried among tangential content, reducing both accuracy and relevance scores.

**Cost:** $0.0062, **Tokens:** 1526

### 76. How are ergänzungsschulen funded?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and provide the same answer to the question. They correctly state that Ergänzungsschulen are funded in whole by charging students tuition fees in the first paragraph, which directly answers the question.

**Cost:** $0.0083, **Tokens:** 2213

### 77. To what pathogen that causes gas gangrene is oxygen poisonous?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and contain the same content. They both mention that oxygen is poisonous to anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene, which correctly answers the question, but they fail to specifically name the pathogen (Clostridium species). Both responses include significant irrelevant information about rainforest hazards and airplane oxygen supplies, severely impacting their relevance and conciseness scores.

**Cost:** $0.0074, **Tokens:** 1926

### 78. What South African law recognized two types of schools?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and contain the correct answer in the first paragraph: the South African Schools Act of 1996 recognizes two categories of schools - 'public' and 'independent'. However, both responses include extensive irrelevant information about schools in India, Victoria (Australia), and New Zealand that has nothing to do with the question about South African law. This significantly reduces the relevance and conciseness scores, though the core answer is accurate and complete.

**Cost:** $0.0081, **Tokens:** 2119

### 79. The presence of who is highly likely even in small projects?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and provide the exact same answer. They both correctly identify that the mortgage banker is highly likely to be present even in relatively small projects, with clear explanation that the owner's equity is the most obvious funding source. The responses include relevant context but also contain additional information that, while related to construction projects, is not directly necessary to answer the specific question.

**Cost:** $0.0065, **Tokens:** 1691

### 80. How many square kilometers of rainforest is covered in the basin?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and contain the exact same information.

Since the responses are identical in content, accuracy, completeness, and relevance, they receive the same score.

**Cost:** $0.0085, **Tokens:** 2358

### 81. What suffered considerably for Warsaw when it had an Eastern Bloc economy?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and provide the same answer to the question. They both correctly identify that infrastructure suffered considerably during Warsaw's time as an Eastern Bloc economy, directly answering the question in the first sentence. However, both responses include extensive additional information about Warsaw's modern economy and history that, while interesting, reduces conciseness and is not directly relevant to what suffered during the Eastern Bloc period.

**Cost:** $0.0083, **Tokens:** 2256

### 82. What was the very first television station to broadcast in Fresno?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and provide the correct answer (KMJ-TV, debuting June 1, 1953) in the first paragraph. However, both responses include four additional paragraphs of completely irrelevant information about Fresno's railroad history, weather records, general city information, and neighborhood descriptions, which significantly hurts their relevance and conciseness scores. The core answer is accurate and complete, but the excessive irrelevant content makes these responses poorly optimized for the specific question asked.

**Cost:** $0.0089, **Tokens:** 2343

### 83. What law connects relative velocities with inertia?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and provide the same comprehensive answer to the question. They clearly identify Newton's First Law of Motion as the law connecting relative velocities with inertia, with the key statement: 'Newton's First Law directly connects inertia with the concept of relative velocities.' Both responses are accurate, complete with historical context and examples, highly relevant to the question, though somewhat lengthy which reduces conciseness slightly.

**Cost:** $0.0097, **Tokens:** 2713

### 84. How did Celeron handle business on trip?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and provide the same information about Céloron's expedition. They accurately describe how Céloron handled business by informing British merchants to leave French territory, burying lead plates to claim land, and threatening Native American chiefs who traded with the British. However, both responses include irrelevant information about Kublai Khan and Paul Marin de la Malgue, which reduces their relevance and conciseness scores.

**Cost:** $0.0086, **Tokens:** 2319

### 85. What was the capital of the Ottoman empire?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and provide the correct answer (Istanbul) buried within the second paragraph, earning full accuracy points. However, both responses suffer from severe relevance issues, including extensive irrelevant information about Warsaw and Polish history, as well as tangential content about the Ottoman Caliphate's abolition. The lack of conciseness and inclusion of largely irrelevant material significantly reduces both scores despite the correct answer being present.

**Cost:** $0.0085, **Tokens:** 2278

### 86. What city in Victoria is called the sporting capital of Australia?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and contain the correct answer to the question - Melbourne is described as the 'sporting capital of Australia' in the second paragraph. However, both responses provide excessive information that is not relevant to the specific question asked, including details about Victoria's economy, history, politics, and tourism, which significantly reduces their conciseness score. The answer is accurate and complete but buried within unnecessary context.

**Cost:** $0.0076, **Tokens:** 2001

### 87. What did Maududi believe Muslim society could not be Islamic in the absence of?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and provide the exact same answer.

### 88. What grew on a global scale as a result of imperialism?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and provide extensive background on imperialism but fail to directly answer the specific question about what grew on a global scale as a result of imperialism. While the text mentions 'the rapid spread of technologies and ideas' and discusses trade in 'animals and plant products,' these answers are buried in lengthy passages about imperialism's definition and history. Neither response concisely identifies what specifically grew globally, resulting in poor relevance and completeness scores for both.

**Cost:** $0.0089, **Tokens:** 2398

### 89. Why did OPEC raise the price of oil to $5.11?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and provide the same comprehensive answer to the question. They accurately explain that OPEC raised oil prices to $5.11 on October 16, 1973, in response to American aid to Israel during the Yom Kippur War, while also providing important context about the Bretton Woods collapse and dollar depreciation that had eroded OPEC's real income. The responses are complete, accurate, and relevant, though somewhat lengthy with some tangential information about later events in the 1980s that reduces conciseness slightly.

**Cost:** $0.0087, **Tokens:** 2230

### 90. If q=9 and a=1,2,4,5,7, or 8, how many primes would be in a progression?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and provide the same answer to the question. The first paragraph directly addresses the question, stating that for q=9 and a=1,2,4,5,7,8, there are infinitely many primes in each progression. However, both responses lose points for including extensive irrelevant information about prime number theory, conjectures, and primality testing that doesn't relate to the specific question asked.

**Cost:** $0.0082, **Tokens:** 2193

### 91. What does the bathocyroe and ocyropsis do to escape danger?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and contain the correct answer buried in the third paragraph: Bathocyroe and Ocyropsis escape danger by clapping their lobes to create a jet of expelled water that drives them backwards very quickly. However, both responses include extensive irrelevant information about hyperbaric medicine, immune barriers, ctenophore predation, and rainforest hazards, severely impacting their conciseness and relevance scores. Each receives 40 points for accuracy (correct answer present), 15 points for completeness (answer is complete but buried), 10 points for relevance (mostly irrelevant content), and -25 points for poor conciseness.

**Cost:** $0.0104, **Tokens:** 2707

### 92. What does  oxygen therapy promote the body to take up?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and provide extensive information about oxygen therapy, but they fail to directly answer the specific question asked. The question asks what oxygen therapy promotes the body to take up, and while the text mentions that oxygen therapy 'increases oxygen levels in the patient's blood' and discusses the body's ability to 'take up and use gaseous oxygen,' it never explicitly states that oxygen therapy promotes the uptake of oxygen (O2). Both responses score poorly on relevance and conciseness due to including excessive tangential information about hyperbaric medicine, recreational oxygen use, and singlet oxygen that doesn't address the core question.

**Cost:** $0.0078, **Tokens:** 1890

### 93. Where did Korea border Kublai's territory?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and contain the exact answer to the question in the first paragraph: Governor Duquesne sent forces under Contrecœur who led 500 men to relieve Saint-Pierre. Both responses include relevant context but also contain several paragraphs of extraneous information about other events and people, reducing their conciseness scores. Since the responses are identical in content, accuracy, completeness, and relevance, they receive the same score.

**Cost:** $0.0093, **Tokens:** 2524

### 98. Which of the tributaries in Germany contributes most?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and provide the same information. They mention the Moselle (300+ m³/s), the Ruhr (70 m³/s), and the Aare (nearly 1,000 m³/s), but fail to clearly identify which tributary in Germany contributes most. The Aare is actually a Swiss tributary, not German, and the question specifically asks about tributaries in Germany, making the Moselle the correct answer among German tributaries mentioned, though this isn't explicitly stated.

**Cost:** $0.0090, **Tokens:** 2377

### 99. Which book discussed the theory about low populations in the Amazon rainforest?

**Winner:** tie

**Reasoning:** Both responses are identical and provide the exact same information. They both correctly identify Betty Meggers' book 'Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise' as discussing the theory about low populations in the Amazon rainforest, which directly answers the question.
